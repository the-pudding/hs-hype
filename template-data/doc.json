In the late 90’s and early 2000’s, teams could bet hard enough on a player’s future success that they could draft them straight out of high school. This ended in 2006 when a <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227065646/http://www.nbpa.com/cba_articles/article-X.php target=_blank>rule</a> was <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/28/sports/basketball/nba-draft-will-close-book-on-high-school-stars.html target=_blank>put into place</a>, declaring that players had to be at least 19 years old or one year removed from high school before getting drafted. But since there are talks about <a href=http://www.nba.com/article/2018/07/10/adam-silver-board-governors-draft-eligibility-age target=_blank>reversing this rule</a> as early as 2021, let’s look at the success of the straight-to-NBA high school players.","skipTitle":"Level Reached of <span class=top>Straight-to-NBA</span> HS Players","skipSub":"Percentage of players that reach each level (out of 35 players) from 1998 - 2005","postSkip":[{"type":"text","value":"Opponents of removing the age limit often cite players like Korleone Young as reasons to keep it in place.
